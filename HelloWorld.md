Hello Ma'am,

Its been about two weeks that I have taken over my duties as Center Head of the Tree House center at Yapral. As was the clear mandate given to me about increasing the number of students in this branch, I have been on this charge as soon as I started. There have been a few challenges for me here. I'm detailing a few below:
Locating this school - I myself had this issue on day one.
No hoardings/ boards or banners about the school anywhere.

Would take this opportunity to update you on some of challenges we face to spread our reach to more kids in our area
