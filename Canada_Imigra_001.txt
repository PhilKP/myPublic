We're constantly monitoring updates for you and glad to bring an important one about Canadian Province - Nova Scotia, which opens an avenue for Canada aspirants to apply for migration under Express Entry Scheme. 

The province of Nova Scotia, located on Canada’s east coast, became the first province to have its enhanced Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) allocation increased in the middle of the year, when it was announced that 300 additional spaces had been allocated for its Express Entry streams. Both of these Nova Scotia streams are aligned with the government of Canada’s Express Entry immigration selection system, which manages the selection of new skilled immigrants to Canada. 
The move will allow Nova Scotia to nominate 1,350 immigrants under the Nova Scotia Nominee Program (NSNP) in 2015, nearly double last year’s cap of 700.
